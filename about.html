<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Mr. Pug, I do music and programing. Pug Hut Studios is something I started a while ago as sort of a hub for all of my online activites and posts.</p>
<p>Pug Hut Studios contains various stuff I do, such as music, games, and anything I may decide to do in the future.</p>
<p>I am in a band called "Rat Paste". We are going to swap genres each album we do, but here's the base of our band's genres:</p>
<p>Punk, Rock, Nu Metal, Heavy Metal, Folk.</p>
<p>I should also mention I'm Transgender MtF and Pansexual. If that pisses you off, get away from me. For those who stayed: My pronouns are She/Her (Preferred) and They/Them.</p>
