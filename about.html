    <h1>About Pughutstudios:</h1>
    <p>Hey, I'm Mr. Pug, I do music and programing. Pug Hut Studios is something I started a while ago as sort of a hub for all of my online activites and posts.</p>
    <p>Pug Hut Studios contains various stuff I do, such as music, games, and anything I may decide to do in the future.</p>
    <p>I am in a band called "Rat Paste," We are going to various stuff with Folk Punk, Nu Metal, and any other genres we may want to incorporate</p>
    <p>I should also mention I'm Transgender MtF and Pansexual. If that pisses you off, get away from me. For those who stayed: My pronouns are She/Her or It/It's (Preferred) and They/Them.</p>
